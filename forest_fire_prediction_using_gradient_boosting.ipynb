    "# Prediction of forest fire in Portugal\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a regression model, we will predict the damaged areas by forest fire on a  region of Portugal. The prediction consist on whether a forest fire can be affected by a fire, and if it is, how many hectareas can be the fire affect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data\n",

    "The data is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires\n",

    "#### Prior results\n",
    "In [Cortez and Morais, 2007], the output 'area' was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function. Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value: 12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect, the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority. \n",
