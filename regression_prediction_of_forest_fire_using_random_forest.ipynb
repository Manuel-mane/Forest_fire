    "# Prediction of forest fire in Portugal\n",
    "\n",
    "Through a regression model, we will predict the damaged areas by forest fire on a  region of Portugal. The prediction consist on whether a forest fire can be affected by a fire, and if it is, how many hectareas can be the fire affect.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is downloaded from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires\n",
    "Data Set Information:\n",
    "\n",
    "In [Cortez and Morais, 2007], the output 'area' was first transformed with a ln(x+1) function. Then, several Data Mining methods were applied. After fitting the models, the outputs were post-processed with the inverse of the ln(x+1) transform. Four different input setups were used. The experiments were conducted using a 10-fold (cross-validation) x 30 runs. Two regression metrics were measured: MAD and RMSE. A Gaussian support vector machine (SVM) fed with only 4 direct weather conditions (temp, RH, wind and rain) obtained the best MAD value: 12.71 +- 0.01 (mean and confidence interval within 95% using a t-student distribution). The best RMSE was attained by the naive mean predictor. An analysis to the regression error curve (REC) shows that the SVM model predicts more examples within a lower admitted error. In effect, the SVM model predicts better small fires, which are the majority. \n",

    "### Features\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `X `- x-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 1 to 9\n",
    "2. `Y `- y-axis spatial coordinate within the Montesinho park map: 2 to 9\n",
    "3. `month` - month of the year: 'jan' to 'dec'\n",
    "4. `day` - day of the week: 'mon' to 'sun'\n",
    "5. `FFMC` - FFMC (Fine Fuel Moisture Code) index from the FWI system: 18.7 to 96.20\n",
    "6. `DMC` - DMC (Dufe moisture Code) index from the FWI system: 1.1 to 291.3\n",
    "7. `DC` - DC (Drought Code) index from the FWI (Fire Weather Index) system: 7.9 to 860.6\n",
    "8. `ISI` - ISI (Initial Spread Index) index from the FWI system: 0.0 to 56.10\n",
    "9. `temp` - temperature in Celsius degrees: 2.2 to 33.30\n",
    "10. `RH` - relative humidity in %: 15.0 to 100\n",
    "11. `wind` - wind speed in km/h: 0.40 to 9.40\n",
    "12. `rain` - outside rain in mm/m2 : 0.0 to 6.4\n",
    "13. `area` - the burned area of the forest (in ha): 0.00 to 1090.84 \n",
    "\n",
    "`FFMC`: Denotes the moisture content surface litter and influences ignition and fire spread. \n",
    "\n",
    "`DMC and DC`: Represent the moisture content of shallow and deep organic layers, which affect fire intensity.\n",
    "\n",
    "`ISI`: Score that correlates with fire velocity spread.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "We will build a regression model able to predict the burned area by forest fire according with the above features. As we have pre processed different dataset through statistical analysis, We will proceed to use some of them to develop the most possible efficient model. In this notebook we will use Random Forest Regressor."
